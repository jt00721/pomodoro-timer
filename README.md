# pomodoro-timer
A command-line or simple web-based Pomodoro timer that tracks and analyzes productivity sessions.

## Features:

    List the planned features (e.g., countdown timer, analytics, data storage).

## Setup Instructions:

    1. Clone the repository:
   
    git clone https://github.com/jt00721/markdown-note-manager.git
    cd markdown-note-manager


    2. Install dependencies:

        go mod tidy

    3. Run the application:

        go run main.go

## Roadmap:

    Day 1: Define Scope and Setup

        Goals
            Define the core features of the timer and analytics.
            Set up the project structure and environment.

        Tasks
            Brainstorm and document the features you want:
                Start/stop a timer for Pomodoro sessions.
                Track the number of sessions completed.
                Provide basic analytics (e.g., total focus time, session streaks).
            Create the project folder and initialize a Go module: go mod init pomodoro-timer.
            Write a README.md with an overview of the project and planned features.

    Day 2: Core Functionality – Timer Logic

        Goals
            Implement the Pomodoro timer logic.
            Handle user input for starting and stopping the timer.

        Tasks
            Build a timer function to count down a set duration (e.g., 25 minutes).
            Add basic CLI interaction (e.g., user starts a timer with a command).
            Provide feedback during the timer (e.g., "Time remaining: 24:59").

    Day 3: Tracking and Analytics Basics

        Goals
            Log completed Pomodoro sessions.
            Calculate basic analytics (e.g., total time focused).

        Tasks
            Create a way to log completed sessions (e.g., store the date, time, and duration in a JSON file).
            Add functionality to calculate:
                Total number of completed sessions.
                Total focus time for the day/week.
            Test the logging and analytics features with sample data.

    Day 4: Break Timer and Enhanced Features

        Goals
            Add a break timer for short and long breaks.
            Refine the overall user flow.

        Tasks
            Implement a short break (e.g., 5 minutes) after each session.
            Add a long break (e.g., 15 minutes) after every 4 sessions.
            Ensure the CLI handles transitions between work sessions and breaks smoothly.
            Test the full timer flow (Pomodoro → short break → Pomodoro → long break).

    Day 5: User Experience Enhancements

        Goals
            Improve the CLI experience with user-friendly messages and prompts.
            Add an optional configuration file for customizing timer durations.

        Tasks
            Allow users to configure work and break durations via a file or command-line arguments.
            Add motivational messages when a session is completed (e.g., "Great job! You've completed another session!").
            Include error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric values).

    Day 6: Testing, Debugging, and Final Touches

        Goals
            Ensure the app works smoothly across all scenarios.
            Finalize core features.

        Tasks
            Test for edge cases:
                Interrupting or stopping a timer early.
                Handling invalid user inputs.
            Debug any issues found during testing.
            Polish the user flow and improve documentation (update README.md).

    Day 7: Wrap-Up and Content Creation

        Goals
            Finalize the project and prepare for your social media post.
            Reflect on the challenges and lessons learned.

        Tasks
            Record a short demo of the Pomodoro Timer in action (e.g., showing the timer countdown and analytics summary).
            Share your final thoughts and project highlights in a social media post.
            Start brainstorming for next week’s project!
